# Homelab 🖥️⚡

Welcome to my homelab. 🎉

This repo exists because I had a spare computer, too much curiosity, and just enough free time to turn it into a server. 😎

## What this repo is (and is not) 🧐

Yes, you *can* clone this repository.
No, you probably *should not* use it as a plug-and-play solution. ❌

This is not a polished product. It is a **guide, reference, and idea dump**. Copy files manually, adapt them, break them, fix them, and learn from them. 💡

Think of this repo as "steal the idea, not the exact setup". 🏴‍☠️

## Why this exists 💭

* To document what I built in my free time 📝
* To keep notes so I do not forget what I did 2 months later 🕒
* To show my interest in Linux, servers, networking, and containers 🐳
* To subtly tell recruiters that yes, I am a nerd and I enjoy this stuff 🤓

## The story 📖

I had a spare computer.
I installed Ubuntu Server on it. 🐧
Then I installed *a lot* of things. 🔧

Most services run in Docker containers because:

* It is easier to manage ✅
* It is harder to completely break (usually) ⚠️
* I can experiment without fear 🚀

Over time this turned into a proper homelab with experiments, mistakes, rewrites, and fixes. 🧪

## What you will find here 🗂️

* Docker and docker-compose files 🐳
* Service configurations ⚙️
* Notes about things that went wrong (and how I fixed them) 🛠️
* Small scripts and random tweaks ✨

## How to use this repo 🏗️

* Read things 📖
* Copy things 📋
* Modify things 🖊️
* Learn things 🎓

Do not blindly deploy things. ❌

## Notes 📝

Some setups are clean. Some are messy. Some exist only because I wanted to see if they would work. 🤷

That is the point. 😏

Enjoy, and may your servers stay online! 🌐
